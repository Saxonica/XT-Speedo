        <h1>Understanding the XT-Speedo reports</h1>
        <h3>Performance metric</h3>
        <p>
            In the overview table, as our "bottom-line" metric we use the sum of the process times (over all tests) 
            for the driver, 
            relative to the sum for the baseline driver. This of course gives greater weighting to tests which 
            take longer; a different choice of computation could well give a different picture. We also give 
            the minimum and maximum values of the relative times for the individual tests, to give an idea of 
            the spread.           
        </p>
        <h3>Measured times and averages</h3>
        <p>
            The times for the three processes for each test are calculated as the average time over a number of runs.
            Currently for each process we run two blocks of iterations, calculating the average time from the 2nd block. 
            For each block, we iterate a process at least 5 times, and for at least 1 second.             
        </p>
        <h3>Relative times</h3>
        <p>
            For individual test processes, we look at the performance times relative to the baseline driver.
            A value of 2 means that the driver takes 2 times as long to perform the process (i.e. it is 2 times slower than the baseline).
            A value of 0.5 means that the driver takes half the time to perform the process (i.e. it is 2 times faster than the baseline).         
        </p>
        <h3>Bar charts</h3>
        <p>
            The bar charts plot a driver's process speeds for each test relative to the baseline driver.
            The axis represents the baseline driver speed. Bars above the axis mean that the
            driver performs a test slower than the baseline, and bars below the axis mean that the driver
            is faster than the baseline.
            The height of the bars corresponds to the number of times slower (above the axis) or faster 
            (below the axis) that the driver is compared to the baseline.
            (This is achieved by using a reciprocal scale below the axis.)
